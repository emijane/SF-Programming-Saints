Our mission is to make the connection between education and application of skills to prepare for entering the development industry. Itâ€™s also to demystify programming by helping students and the community to better understand what programming is and how to use it.

The purpose of this organization is to provide an opportunity for students of Santa Fe College to develop real world projects as an application of learned skills. The club will achieve this by organizing community-inspired programming projects, team events, workshops, and volunteer outreach services. We accept all Santa Fe College students with an interest in the computer development process.

# ðŸ’¡ Are you eager to learn?
With collaboration amongst other club members, guest speakers, and working on real projects, you can develop vital programming skills, and create important connections with peers that you will need in your career.
